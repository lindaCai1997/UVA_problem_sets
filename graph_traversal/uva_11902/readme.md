# Cheat sheet:
1. dfs(0) twice for each node X, once including connections from x, and once not including connections from x.
Each node that can be traversed from 0, but cannot be traversed without connections from x is 'Y'.
All other nodes are 'N'.
   
2. Make sure your printing format match EXACTLY like the sample output.
