# UVA_problem_sets
My Github is so empty that I look like an idot.
In order to not look like a complete idiot, I'm gonna start putting my UVA solutions on github.

I will program mostly in c++11. In "Readme" inside the folders, I will state the difficulty level, problem number, and my approach to solve the problem. These solutions are not perfect, but are definitely solutions accepted by the online judge.
