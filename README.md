# UVA_problem_sets
In order to keep track of UVA problem I have solved, I'm goint to start organizing my UVA solutions here.

I program mostly in c++11. In "Readme" inside the folders, I will state the difficulty level, problem number, and my approach to solve the problem. These solutions are not perfect, but are definitely solutions accepted by the online judge.
